grml-live-fai - FAI to minifai migration guide for grml-live

Description
-----------

grml-live historically used link:http://fai-project.org/[FAI] (Fully Automatic Installation)
as its build system. Starting with grml-live version 0.52, the project has migrated to its own
minimal implementation called "minifai". This document explains the differences between the
two implementations and what grml-live users can expect from the transition.

Background
----------

FAI is a comprehensive system for unattended installation and configuration of Linux systems.
grml-live originally used FAI to build its Live Linux systems, but only utilized a small subset
of FAI's functionality. Over time, grml-live required various workarounds and hooks to adapt
FAI's assumptions to the specific needs of building Live systems.

The minifai implementation was created to address these issues by providing a focused,
streamlined implementation that supports only the features actually needed by grml-live,
while maintaining backward compatibility with FAI's class-based configuration approach.

What is minifai?
----------------

minifai is a minimal reimplementation of the FAI API surface that grml-live requires. It is
implemented as a single Python script (`usr/lib/grml-live/minifai`) that provides the same
class-based configuration system as FAI but with a much simpler architecture.

IMPORTANT: Users should not run minifai directly. minifai is an internal implementation
detail of grml-live. Continue using grml-live as before - it will automatically use minifai
instead of FAI for the build process.

Key Features Preserved
----------------------

The following FAI features are fully supported by minifai and work identically to the
original FAI implementation:

Class-based Configuration::
  The core concept of organizing configuration by classes remains unchanged. Package lists,
  scripts, file overlays, and hooks are still organized in the same directory structure
  under `config/`.

Configuration Scripts::
  Scripts in `config/scripts/` are executed in the same manner, with the same environment
  variables and execution order.

Media build Scripts::
  Scripts in `config/media-scripts/` are similarly executed, but are run to build the
  media (ISO) contents. They have access to the same environment variables.

Hooks::
  Hook scripts in `config/hooks/` (updatebase, instsoft) are executed at the same points
  in the build process.

Environment Variables::
  Class-specific environment variables from `config/env/` are loaded and available to
  scripts.

Debconf Preseeding::
  Debconf configurations in `config/debconf/` are applied before package installation.

Helper Tools::
  The `ifclass`, `fcopy`, and `skiptask` commands are available in scripts with the same
  basic functionality.

Differences from FAI
--------------------

The following differences exist between FAI and minifai:

Scope::
  minifai only implements the subset of FAI functionality used by grml-live. Advanced FAI
  features like network booting, partitioning, and complex installation scenarios are not
  supported.

Dependencies::
  FAI is no longer required as a system dependency. grml-live now uses `mmdebstrap` for
  base system installation instead of FAI's `fai-do-baseinstall`.

Package Installation::
  While package lists in `config/package_config/` are parsed similarly, the installation
  process differs. minifai installs packages class by class, then performs a final
  installation of all packages together to detect relationship errors. Some advanced
  package_config features may not be fully supported, such as complex conditional
  statements or advanced package selection syntax.

  Additionally, minifai has stricter error handling for package installation. If a package
  listed in the package_config files is not available (e.g., due to a typo or because the
  package no longer exists in the repository), minifai will abort the build process. FAI
  was more tolerant of such errors and would continue the build despite missing packages.

File Overlays (fcopy)::
  The `fcopy` command provides core functionality but with some limitations compared to
  FAI's full implementation. Supported features include basic file copying, recursive
  copying (-r), ignore missing files (-i), and mode setting (-m user,group,mode).
  However, some advanced fcopy features may not be implemented, and the class precedence
  order for file selection may differ from FAI in edge cases.

Task Execution::
  The FAI task system is simplified. minifai supports the core tasks (updatebase, instsoft,
  configure) but not the full range of FAI tasks.

Error Handling::
  minifai provides more targeted error messages and simplified error handling compared to
  FAI's comprehensive but sometimes complex error reporting.

Logging and Debugging::
  The build process now produces a comprehensive, unified log output that flows directly
  to the terminal and build logs. Unlike FAI's approach of splitting output across
  multiple log files, minifai provides a single, chronological log stream that makes
  it easier to follow the build process and debug issues. All build output is captured
  in one place, making troubleshooting more straightforward.

Migration Considerations
------------------------

For most grml-live users, the migration to minifai should be transparent. However, be aware
of the following:

Compatibility::
  Existing grml-live configurations should work without modification for standard use cases.
  The class-based configuration system is preserved, but complex package configurations or
  advanced fcopy usage may require testing.

Package Lists::
  Review your package_config files to ensure all listed packages are available and
  correctly spelled. Unlike FAI, minifai will fail if any package cannot be installed,
  so obsolete or misnamed packages must be removed from the configuration.

Build Scripts::
  If you have custom build scripts that directly invoke FAI commands, these may need to be
  updated. The `scripts/migrate-to-minifai` script can help with this transition.

Package Selection::
  If your configuration uses advanced package selection syntax beyond basic package names
  and architecture-specific sections, review the package installation to ensure all
  expected packages are included.

File Overlays::
  Test that file overlays work as expected, particularly if you rely on complex class
  precedence rules or advanced fcopy options.

Testing Your Configuration
--------------------------

To ensure your configuration works correctly with minifai:

1. Test build your configuration with the current grml-live version
2. Compare the resulting ISO functionality with previous builds
3. Check that all expected packages are installed (see `$OUTPUT/grml_chroot/grml-live/log/install_packages.list`)
4. Verify that custom scripts execute correctly
5. Ensure file overlays are applied as expected

If you encounter issues, the `scripts/migrate-to-minifai` script may help identify
configuration elements that need adjustment.

Benefits of minifai
-------------------

The migration to minifai provides several advantages:

Simplified Dependencies::
  No longer need to install and configure FAI as a system dependency.

Improved Reliability::
  Fewer moving parts mean fewer potential points of failure. Stricter error handling
  ensures that build issues are caught early rather than producing broken systems.

Better Integration::
  minifai is designed specifically for grml-live's use case, resulting in better
  integration and fewer workarounds.

Easier Maintenance::
  The focused implementation is easier to maintain and extend for grml-live-specific needs.

Clearer Debugging::
  Unified log output makes it much easier to understand the build process and troubleshoot
  issues compared to FAI's scattered log files.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you experience issues after the migration:

Check Error Messages::
  minifai provides clear error messages that typically indicate the specific issue.

Package Installation Errors::
  If the build fails due to unavailable packages, review the package_config files and
  remove or correct any problematic package names.

Verify Configuration::
  Ensure your class-based configuration follows the expected structure and syntax.

Review Build Output::
  The unified log output provides comprehensive information about the build process.
  Look for error messages or unexpected behavior in the chronological log stream.

Check Package Installation::
  Review `$OUTPUT/grml_chroot/grml-live/log/install_packages.list` to verify all
  expected packages were installed.

Test File Overlays::
  Manually verify that files from `config/files/` are copied to the expected locations
  in the target system.

Use Migration Script::
  Run `scripts/migrate-to-minifai` to check for potential compatibility issues.
